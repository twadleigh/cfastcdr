# cfastcdr

`cfastcdr` is a C interface to the [Fast-CDR](https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-CDR) C++ library. It is written to facilitate the use of Fast-CDR in languages other than those supported upstream. As such, it is somewhat low-level interface. It is expected that users will wrap it in a safer high-level interface.

The functionality the library exposes is documented upstream, while the peculiarities of the C interface are documented in [the header file](cfastcdr.h).
